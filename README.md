# R4CRF

R4CRF is a lightweight R-based demo project that showcases how to create clinical trial tables in RTF format using the [`r2rtf`](https://github.com/phuse-org/r2rtf) package. The goal is to provide a reproducible and easy-to-follow example for generating demographic tables commonly used in clinical research.

## Files

- **ADSL.csv**  
  Sample subject-level analysis dataset (ADaM ADSL format) used as input for the table generation.

- **T_01_01_1_DM.R**  
  R script that demonstrates how to read the data and use `r2rtf` to produce a demographic table (Table 1) in RTF format.

- **T_01_01_1_Dm.rtf**  
  Example RTF output generated by the R script, representing a typical demographic summary table.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `T_01_01_1_DM.R` in RStudio or your preferred R environment.
3. Make sure the `r2rtf` package is installed (`install.packages("r2rtf")`).
4. Run the script to regenerate the demographic table based on the sample data.
